/**
 * @brief Helper class to track nearest neighbors.
 *
 * This is a priority queue that tracks the nearest neighbors of an observation of interest.
 * Specifically, it contains indices and distances of the `k` nearest neighbors, in decreasing order from the top of the queue.
 * When the queue is at capacity and new elements are added, existing elements will be displaced by incoming elements with shorter distances.
 *
 * This class is intended to be used in implementations of `Searcher::search()` to track the `k`-nearest neighbors.
 * When searching for neighbors of an existing observation in the dataset, it is recommended to search for the `k + 1` neighbors.
 * The appropriate `report()` overload can then be used to remove the observation of interest from its own neighbor list.
 *
 * @tparam Index_ Integer type for the observation indices.
 * @tparam Distance_ Floating point type for the distances.
