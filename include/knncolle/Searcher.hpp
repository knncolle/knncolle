 * @brief Interface for searching nearest-neighbor search indices.

 * Instances of `Searcher` subclasses are typically constructed with `Prebuilt::initialize()`.
 * This is intended to allow re-use of data allocations across different calls to `search()`.
 * Users should ensure that a `Searcher` instance does not outlive the `Prebuilt` object used to generate it;
 * this allows developers of the former to hold references to the latter.
 *
 * @tparam Index_ Integer type for the observation indices.
 * @tparam Data_ Numeric type for the query data.
 * @tparam Distance_ Floating point type for the distances.
